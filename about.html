            <h5>The Ministries</h5>
            <p>The name of the ministry is Waymaker International Ministry(WIM)
              This name was derived from the Book of Isaiah 45: 2 which says, ‘I will go before you an make the crooked places straight; I will break in pieces the gates of bronze and cut the bars of iron.’ (NKJV)
              
            </p>

            <p>Waymaker International Ministry (also known as WIM) is an interdenominational Christian Ministry which was granted the certificate of incorporation on the 10th day of November, 2021 by the Corporate Affairs Commission(CAC) for the purpose of preaching the gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ and other related activities as enumerated in the aims and objectives of the ministry.
              The registration number of the ministry is 169068

        <h5>Revd. Dr. Supo Ayokunle</h5>
        <p>The vision for this ministry was caught by Rev. Dr. Samson Olasupo Adeniyi Ayokunle (also known as Supo Ayokunle) and his wife. However, Rev. Dr. Samson Olasupo A. Ayokunle is the President of the Ministry.
          Ministering to the ‘Body of Christ’ without inhibition or denominational barrier was the original vision of Rev. Dr. Supo Ayokunle about four decades ago. He started with village evangelism and moved on to become an itinerant evangelist, ministering from church to church and being involved in open air crusades. He didn’t want to be pastor over any church but to operate as ‘a tent-making minister’ otherwise known as ‘bi-vocational minister,’ However, after operating as an itinerant evangelist for few years, God divinely disrupted his plan through revelations,  ‘still small voice’ and prophecies from others that he must go to the Nigerian Baptist Theological Seminary for training. He painfully obeyed and God glorified himself in that obedience through what he made out of him while ministering as a Baptist Minister. To God alone the glory belongs.
        </p>

        <p>In the Baptist denomination, all Pastors must retire at age 65, though this does not mean that a retired Baptist Pastor cannot be called by the Baptist churches or any other church for one gospel assignment or the other. The retirement policy of the Baptist denomination is hinged upon the Leviticus injunction in Numbers 8: 23-26 which says: 

          “Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, “This is what pertains to the Levites: From twenty-five years old and above one may enter to perform service in the work of the tabernacle of meeting; and at the age of fifty years they must cease performing this work, and shall work no more. They may minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of meeting, to attend to needs, but they themselves shall do no work. Thus you shall do to the Levites regarding their duties.
          
          After obeying the Lord to serve in the Baptist Church to the age of retirement, Rev. Dr. Supo Ayokunle perceives strongly that he should go back to his initial ministry as itinerant evangelist to continue to minister to the whole Church of Christ irrespective of denomination as long as God grants him the sound health to do so. He is of the opinion that the gifts and the calling of God are without repentance or irrevocable.(Romans 11: 29) The Ministry would kick off with television and radios broadcasts as long as the Lord provides for it through ministry supporters.
